# Pacman-Game
Use Python to implement BFS, DFS, A* and other search algorithms to generate the optimal path for Pacman to reach the target.
When confronted with obstacles or moving monsters, Pac-Man can avoid them perfectly and eat all the food along the shortest, fastest, and best path.

Run the Pacman.py in pacman game.zip
